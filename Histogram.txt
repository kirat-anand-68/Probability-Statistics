Histograms and stem-and-leaf plots
A histogram, also called a frequency histogram, is just like a bar graph,
except that we collect the data into buckets or bins, and then sketch a bar
for each bucket. Each bucket needs to be the same size, or width, so that
they’re capable of holding the same amount of data.
Unlike bar charts, histograms have no gaps between the bars (although
some bars might be absent, which means there’s no frequency in that
“bucket”). A histogram represents a continuous data set, which is why
there are no gaps between the buckets.
One reason we might want to use a histogram instead of a bar graph is
because we have too many data points to plot individually. For example,
maybe we want to use census data to make a graph of the number of
people of each age in the entire city of San Francisco. In a typical bar
graph, we have to show a bar for children younger that 1, another for 1
-year-olds, for 2-year-olds, 3, 4, 5, all the way up to 100 or maybe even
older. In other words, our bar graph might have 100 bars or more.
